		<h2 id="GeneralInformation">General Information</h2>
		<p> Bats are mammal creatures that are capable of flying despite their size. 
			They appear as black/brown/red/tan/gray rodents or weasels with short snorts and large wings (3x their body). 
			In winter, bats either hibernate or mirgrate to warmer areas. Those hat hibernate build up fat reserves to sustain them throughout the winter. If they are disturbed, their fat reserve could get wasted and they could die to the cold, prior to spring.</p>
		<h2 id="Whereabouts">Whereabouts</h2>
		
		<p>They can be found in every part of the planet other than extreme deserts and polar regions.
			On a day to day basis, bats stay in daytime retreats such as caves, rocks crevices, old buildings, bridges, mines and trees. This is because bats are nocturnal so they need to stay in a dark place in order to sleep.</p>
			
		<h2 id="Diet">Diet</h2>
	
		<p> Bats are omnivores, so they eat both plants/fruits and animals.</p>
	    <h3>Carnivorous Diet</h3>
		<p>For carnivorous food, bats tend to eat</p>
			<ul>
				<li>insects</li>
				<li>small mice</li>
				<li>birds</li>
				<li>lizards</li>
				<li>frogs</li> 
				<li> and fish</li> 
			</ul>
		<p>Sometimes they even eat other bats.</p>
		<h3>Herbivorous Diet</h3>
		<p>As for herbivorous food, bats eat</p>
			<ul>
				<li>avocados</li>
				<li>mangoes</li>
				<li>bananas</li>
				<li>wild dates</li>
				<li>and more</li> 
			</ul>

		<p> They are nocturnal creatures that are also capable of using a skill/ability called echolocation.
			Echolocation is a skill that bats produce by emitting high frequency sound pulses from their mouth or nose.
			Then they listen to the echo. 
			With this echo, bats can determine the texture, shape and size of the objects that are in the vicinity of the area/environment.
			Some people believe that bats are blind since they don't look like they have eyes, and they use this skill in order to see/sense things.
			But actually this is not the case. Bats are not blind, but rather, they have small eyes with very sensitive vision, 
			which only usually helps in areas that we see as pitch black.</p>
			
		<p>While I have said lots of info about bat's echolocation skills, the National Park Service Official website on <a href = "https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bats/echolocation.htm#:~:text=Bats%20navigate%20and%20find%20insect,off%20objects%20in%20their%20environment.&text=The%20bat%20calls%20can%20be,humans%20can%20see%20and%20hear."> bat's echolocation</a> has a lot more in-depth research on the affects of it, the sound of it and the way the sound looks.</p>
		
		<p>That's all about bats for now! 
				But if you want to know more about creatures similar to bats, I recommend looking at my second page which talks about <a href="FlyingLemurs.html">flying lemurs</a> &lang;They are quite cute&rang;.</p>
